<h2>About A11y Paradise</h2>
<p>My name is Bob Dodd. I have spent over 25 years working in digital accessibility — as a web developer, as head of accessibility at the <a href="https://www.cnib.ca/">Canadian National Institute for the Blind (CNIB)</a>, and as an academic researcher in adaptive user interfaces.</p>
<p>This project exists to make sure that practical, hard-won accessibility knowledge doesn't retire when I do. Everything here is freely available:</p>
<ul>
    <li>Training materials covering standards, development techniques, testing, and organizational practices</li>
    <li>Open-source tools for accessibility testing and auditing</li>
    <li>Curated resources from the wider accessibility community</li>
</ul>
<p>The source for all of this lives at <a href="https://github.com/bobdodd/a11y-paradise">a11y-paradise on GitHub</a>.</p>
