# Accessibility Testing

Manual and automated testing methodology, tools, and workflows.

## Scope

- **Manual testing** — keyboard testing, screen reader testing (NVDA, JAWS, VoiceOver, TalkBack), visual inspection, and cognitive walkthroughs
- **Automated testing** — tools, what they catch, what they miss, and how to integrate them into CI/CD
- **Testing workflows** — building accessibility testing into development processes
- **Reporting** — documenting and communicating findings effectively
- **Prioritization** — how to triage accessibility issues by impact and effort

## Approach

Testing materials are grounded in practical experience. They cover not just how to run a tool, but how to interpret results, identify false positives, and find the issues that automated tools miss entirely.
