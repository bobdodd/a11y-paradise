# Accessibility Standards

Deep dives into the standards that define digital accessibility requirements.

## Scope

- **WCAG** (Web Content Accessibility Guidelines) — principles, guidelines, success criteria, and sufficient techniques
- **WAI-ARIA** — roles, states, properties, and authoring practices for dynamic web content
- **PDF/UA** — the ISO standard for accessible PDF documents
- **EN 301 549** — the European standard for ICT accessibility, including its relationship to WCAG
- **Other standards** — Section 508, AODA, ADA digital requirements, and emerging standards

## Approach

These materials go beyond restating the standards. They explain the intent behind requirements, show how standards interact with each other, and highlight where real-world implementation diverges from specification.
