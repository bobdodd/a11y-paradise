# Organizational Accessibility Practices

Building accessibility into organizational culture, procurement, policies, and processes.

## Scope

- **Born accessible** — designing organizations where accessibility is the default, not an afterthought
- **Accessibility maturity models** — assessing and improving an organization's accessibility capability
- **Procurement** — requiring and evaluating accessibility in purchasing decisions
- **Policy and governance** — accessibility policies, standards adoption, and compliance frameworks
- **Training and awareness** — building accessibility knowledge across an organization
- **Roles and responsibilities** — who owns accessibility and how to structure teams for success

## Approach

These materials draw on direct experience building and maintaining accessibility practices within a large organization (CNIB). They address the human and process challenges that are often harder to solve than the technical ones.
