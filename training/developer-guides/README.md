# Developer Guides

Practical how-to guides for building accessible web applications, components, and patterns.

## Scope

- Accessible HTML, CSS, and JavaScript patterns
- ARIA implementation — when to use it, when not to, and common mistakes
- Accessible forms, navigation, data tables, and interactive widgets
- Framework-specific guidance (React, Vue, Angular, etc.)
- Accessible single-page applications
- Mobile web accessibility
- Accessible multimedia and documents

## Approach

Each guide is written for developers who may not be accessibility specialists. Guides include working code examples, explain the "why" behind each technique, and flag common pitfalls from real-world projects.
